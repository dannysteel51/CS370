# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given the code for the environment, the given experience for replay, the build model, and the code to play the game. I was tasked with creating the code for the Q-learning algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

As a computer scientist, one finds solutions to everyday problems using algorithmic functions. Using these functions, CS can solve probelms and answer questions that can't otherwise be answered through conventional means, or the answer would take far too long without the add of the computer's speed. This ability has significant value in many walks of life, such as the health field, military defense, schooling, and so on. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I like to take the problem and ruminate on it for a while. From day one of school to this point, I've realized the beauty of coding and Computer Science as a whole is that more times than naught there are mulitple answers to the same question. Some solutions are quicker but are heftier, taking of more memory, while some of more robust take longer to run but take far less memory. Knowing this, I try to find the middle-ground. And once I have my plan, I break it down into individual steps that I can check off as I go. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Privacy is key. This includes names, birthdates and any other identification that belongs to an end user. But beyond that, while developing any applicaiton, whether it be a straight forward app or an AI run machine, the developer needs to keep in mind the ramifications that might occur once the project is out in the public. Might the program cause any unwanted breaches in security? Are the algorithms that steer the AI too broad, allowing the AI to learn things it shouldn't? And if so, what might happen if that imformation is gathered and then stolen? All these things need to be in the mind of the developer and the organization they work for. All it takes is one breach and an entire company can lose face.
